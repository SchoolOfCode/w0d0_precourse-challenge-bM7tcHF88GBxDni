        Starting in 1993 and ending in 1999, Deep Space Nine is now regarded
        as one of the best science fiction shows ever created.
        <br />
        <br />
        It's emotionally resonant and builds a political and complicated
        world. While there are plenty of episodic stories, Deep Space Nine is
        one of the first TV shows to do long form narrative arcs that are the
        norm today. It's an exceptional feat to remain one of the best serial
        TV shows 25 years later.

      <p>
        A plethora of 10 main cast members and up to 40 recurring roles lead
        to a world that feels real and independent. Characters have their own
        agency and interpersonal relationships, engrossing viewing as we find
        our characters in morally compromised and conflicting situations.

        Deep Space Nine is a Cardassian built mining space station owned by
        the Bajorans and operated with the Federation. The first episode of
        Deep Space Nine starts after the end of an oppressive occupation of
        the planet Bajor by the Cardassians. The Bajoran Provisional
        Government requested Federation assistance and Commander Sisko is sent
        to the station in a joint venture with the Bajoran militia.
